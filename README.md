## Goals:

- Correct faction relations to make some semblance of sense: *Done*

  (As with DrX Dynamic Faction Relations, this is not compatible with Story Mode)

- Remove nazi (Addaraya, Firelake, Shnur), pederast (Shnur, tATu) and other degenerate/western cancer from the soundtrack, and reorganize the radio stations into one lyrical and one intstrumental *Done*

- Remove silly monsters (e.g. burers, controllers, fractures, poltergeists, psy-dogs, pyrogeists, snorks, zombies)

- Correct loadouts so factions use appropriate weapons and ammo
