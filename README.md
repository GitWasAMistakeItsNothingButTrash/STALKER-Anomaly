## Goals:

- Correct faction relations to make some semblance of sense: *Done*
![Stalker_faction_relations_differential.png](https://github.com/GitWasAMistakeItsNothingButTrash/STALKER-Anomaly/blob/master/Stalker_faction_relations_differential%20-%20Copy.png)
  (As with DrX Dynamic Faction Relations, this is not compatible with Story Mode)

- Remove nazi (Addaraya, Firelake, Shnur), pederast (Shnur, tATu) and other degenerate/western cancer from the soundtrack *Done*

- Reorganize radio stations into one lyrical and one intstrumental *Done*

- Remove redundant (e.g. fractures, karliks, snorks, zombies) and silly monsters (e.g. burers, controllers, poltergeists, psy-dogs, psy-suckers, pyrogeists)

- Edit loadouts so factions use weapons and ammo that make some semblance of sense
