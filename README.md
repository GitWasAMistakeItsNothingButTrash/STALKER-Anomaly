  (As with DrX Dynamic Faction Relations, this is not compatible with Story Mode)

- Remove nazi (Addaraya, Firelake), pederast (tATu) and other degenerate/western cancer from the soundtrack, and reorganize the radio stations into one lyrical and one intstrumental *Done*

- Remove silly monsters

- Correct loadouts so factions use appropriate weapons and ammo
