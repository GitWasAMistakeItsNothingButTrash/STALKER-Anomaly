Goals:

- Correct faction relations to make some semblance of sense:

  (As with DrX Dynamic Faction Relations, this is not compatible with Story Mode)

- Remove nazi (Firelake, Addaraya), pederast (tATu) and other degenerate/western cancer from the soundtrack, reorganize the radio stations into one lyrical and one intstrumental

- Remove silly monsters

- Correct loadouts so factions use appropriate weapons and ammo
