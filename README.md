## Goals:

- Correct faction relations to make some semblance of sense:
![Stalker_faction_relations_differential.png](https://github.com/GitWasAMistakeItsNothingButTrash/STALKER-Anomaly/blob/master/Stalker_faction_relations_differential%20-%20Copy.png)
  (As with DrX Dynamic Faction Relations, this is not compatible with Story Mode.) \
  *Done*

- Remove nazi (Addaraya, Bi-2, Firelake, Shnur), pederast (Shnur, tATu) and other western (America, Blue States, Croce, Dazeem, Dire Straits, Eagles, Hendrix, Pink Floyd, Radiohead, Scorpions, Soulsavers, Tito & Tarantula, U2, Vaughan) cancer from the soundtrack. \
  *Done*

- Reorganize radio stations into one lyrical and one intstrumental. \
  *Done*

- Remove creatures that are silly (such as those with psy abilities, such as telekinesis, possession, invisibility or spawning phantoms) or redundant (all variants of human zombies that are classed as monsters rather than stalkers). \
  *Set to non-hostile and removed from spawn registry. Requires testing.*

- Edit loadouts so factions use weapons and ammo that make some semblance of sense. \
(For example, UN operatives would never be deployed with a sawn-off TOZ-66, have no guns that can even mount a PSO scope, and have no need of an MP5A3 or UMP45 when an MP5SD6 and FN P90 are available to them.) \
  *Item tabulation in progress*
